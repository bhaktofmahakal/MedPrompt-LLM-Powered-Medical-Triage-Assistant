# MedPrompt: AI-Powered Medical Triage Assistant

![MedPrompt Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/MedPrompt-AI%20Medical%20Triage-4361ee?style=for-the-badge&logo=medical&logoColor=white)

MedPrompt is a sophisticated medical triage assistant powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that analyzes patient-reported symptoms and provides evidence-based care recommendations. By combining advanced NLP capabilities with medical knowledge retrieval, MedPrompt helps users understand the potential severity of their symptoms and directs them to appropriate care pathways.

## üåü Key Features

- **Intelligent Symptom Analysis**: Leverages MedLLaMA 2, a specialized medical LLM, to analyze and interpret complex symptom descriptions
- **Evidence-Based Responses**: Integrates with PubMed through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to provide medically accurate information
- **Multi-Level Triage System**: Classifies symptoms into five severity levels and recommends appropriate care pathways
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Clean, intuitive UI with real-time feedback and accessibility features
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully manages connection issues, timeouts, and resource limitations
- **Pediatric Symptom Recognition**: Specialized patterns for recognizing and appropriately triaging children's symptoms
- **Chronic Condition Management**: Intelligent assessment of worsening chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, and chronic pain

## üî¨ Technical Architecture

### 1. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline
- **Real-time PubMed Integration**: Searches and retrieves relevant medical literature based on symptom descriptions
- **Vector Embedding**: Uses sentence-transformers to create semantic embeddings of medical texts
- **FAISS Vector Store**: Efficiently indexes and retrieves relevant medical information
- **Context Enhancement**: Augments LLM prompts with evidence-based medical information
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provides graceful degradation when external services are unavailable

### 2. Advanced Triage System
- **Pattern-Based Classification**: Uses sophisticated regex patterns to identify symptom severity
- **Multi-Symptom Analysis**: Intelligently parses and evaluates multiple symptoms simultaneously
- **Severity Hierarchy**: Implements a priority-based classification system that highlights the most urgent concerns
- **Specialized Pattern Recognition**: Contains over 100 medical patterns for accurate symptom classification
- **Care Pathway Mapping**: Maps severity levels to appropriate healthcare settings (Emergency Room, Urgent Care, etc.)
- **Age-Appropriate Recommendations**: Provides different guidance for pediatric vs. adult cases

### 3. LLM Integration
- **Local Inference**: Uses Ollama to run MedLLaMA 2 locally, ensuring privacy and reducing latency
- **Optimized Prompting**: Carefully crafted prompts that combine symptom information, triage results, and medical context
- **Resource Management**: Intelligent handling of memory constraints and timeout scenarios
- **Response Formatting**: Structured outputs with explanations, self-care advice, and warning signs

### 4. FastAPI Backend
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handles multiple requests efficiently
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully manages exceptions and provides helpful error messages
- **Health Monitoring**: Includes health check endpoints for system monitoring
- **Static File Serving**: Efficiently serves the frontend application

## üìä Triage Classification System

MedPrompt classifies symptoms into five severity levels:

| Severity Level | Description | Care Pathway | Example Symptoms |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Emergency** | Life-threatening conditions requiring immediate medical attention | Emergency Room | Severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, stroke symptoms |
| **Urgent** | Serious conditions requiring prompt care within 24 hours | Urgent Care | High fever, persistent vomiting, moderate injuries |
| **Semi-Urgent** | Conditions requiring care within 72 hours | Primary Care | Ear infections, mild sprains, worsening chronic conditions |
| **Routine** | Non-urgent conditions requiring medical attention | Telehealth | Medication refills, mild symptoms, follow-up care |
| **Self-Care** | Minor conditions that can be managed at home | Self-Management | Common cold, minor headaches, mild allergies |

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Example Test Cases

Test the application with these symptom scenarios to evaluate its performance:

#### 1. Mild Symptoms
- "I've had a mild cough for 2 days"
- "I have a slight headache and feel tired"
- "My skin is itchy but there's no rash"

#### 2. Moderate Symptoms
- "I've had a fever of 101¬∞F for the past day with body aches"
- "My ankle is swollen after falling yesterday"
- "I've had diarrhea for 3 days but am still drinking fluids"

#### 3. Severe Symptoms
- "I have a severe headache with fever and stiff neck"
- "I'm experiencing chest pain that radiates to my left arm"
- "I can't catch my breath and my lips look bluish"

#### 4. Chronic Conditions

# Reduce context size to help with memory issues
"num_ctx": 2048,
# Use GPU if available
"num_gpu": 1
```

### Timeout Settings
Adjust the timeout value based on your system's performance:
```python
# Reduce timeout for faster feedback on slow systems
timeout=15  # seconds
```

### PubMed API Configuration
